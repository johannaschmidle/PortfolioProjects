      "I legit never do reviews but look at my little couch queen. The assembly was easy, just fluffed it a bit. It smelled like packaging so I washed it first and she started using it instantly. Legit adorable. Her couch is next to ours and I just can't. It's soft, the quality is nice. The size is good for one...fluffy cat. Our other 2 cats might need their own because this one won't share but absolutely worth.\n",

This one is like a Mini version .  so not worth the price it should be about 25.00 . they also do not sit up like in the photos. They lack stuffing by Alot. They just fall flat like a blanket.  I do NOT recommend anything from this seller.\n",

I haven‚Äôt gotten to clean the couch yet but I‚Äôm sure it would be easy to just take off the cover and wash it and then hang to dry. It does collect some hair but can be removed with a lint roller.

She loves snuggling in blankets or on top of me when I‚Äôm sitting w/ a blanket which if fine occasionally but when I‚Äôm up and down she gets annoyed. Now she has her own little couch ü•∞ it‚Äôs perfect! Put it together and put some catnip on it and five mins she‚Äôs snoozin. So glad I took the chance and bought this.For those complaining of the stuffing being thin- you have to spend a few mins with each cushion before inserting into the cover - and fluff the heck out of it and it‚Äôs fine.\n",

Just note the length when purchasing. That was my personal fault, but honestly I would have still bought it anyway. I made an extra extension to my window area by adding a piece of wood to sit the couch on and they love sitting on it with the window up in the sun. Just an idea for people to consider\n",
