This one is like a Mini version .  so not worth the price it should be about 25.00 . they also do not sit up like in the photos. They lack stuffing by Alot. They just fall flat like a blanket.  I do NOT recommend anything from this seller.\n",

I haven’t gotten to clean the couch yet but I’m sure it would be easy to just take off the cover and wash it and then hang to dry. It does collect some hair but can be removed with a lint roller. Would purchase again.\n",

      "My girl is a hefty kitty. I was worried she wouldn’t fit but it’s perfect. She loves snuggling in blankets or on top of me when I’m sitting w/ a blanket which if fine occasionally but when I’m up and down she gets annoyed. Now she has her own little couch 🥰 it’s perfect! Put it together and put some catnip on it and five mins she’s snoozin. So glad I took the chance and bought this.For those complaining of the stuffing being thin- you have to spend a few mins with each cushion before inserting into the cover - and fluff the heck out of it and it’s fine.\n",

Just note the length when purchasing. That was my personal fault, but honestly I would have still bought it anyway. I made an extra extension to my window area by adding a piece of wood to sit the couch on and they love sitting on it with the window up in the sun. Just an idea for people to consider\n",
