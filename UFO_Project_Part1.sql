-- Steps for cleaning the data
-- 1. Create a second table to perform on
-- 2. Remove Duplicates
-- 3. Standardize the data and fix errors
-- 		a. Change rows where duration_hours_min is nonsensical and make it uniform 
-- 		b. Rename countries that donâ€™t make sense (and make the countries full names instead of abbreviations)
-- 		c. Change date columns from text to date
-- 		d. Clean non-alphabetic characters from text columns
-- 		e. Convert all blanks to nulls 
-- 4. Populate null values
-- 5. Drop columns and rows that are not needed 

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Create a Second Table
-- In case we make a mistake we have the untouched database 

CREATE TABLE sightings_staging_dup
LIKE sightings;
-- "dup" at the end just indicates that this table still contains duplicates, I will create a sightings_staging table that does
-- not have duplicates in step 2

INSERT sightings_staging_dup

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Remove Duplicates
-- First, I must check for duplicates

WITH duplicates AS

	SELECT * ,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
		PARTITION BY datetime, city, state, country, shape, duration_hours_min, duration_seconds, comments, date_posted, latitude, longitude
	) AS row_num
	FROM sightings_staging_dup
)
SELECT * FROM duplicates WHERE row_num > 1;

-- The table seems to only one duplicate. I will delete this. 
-- To do this I will create a new table called sightings_staging which will include row_num column
-- and then I will insert the appropriate data

-- 3. Standardize the data
-- a. work with duration_hours_min and duration_seconds --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- I want to see the rows where the duration columns are nonsensical and unusable 

-- First I am checking where we are missing information about the duration
SELECT * 
FROM sightings_staging
WHERE (duration_hours_min = "" AND duration_seconds != 0) OR (duration_hours_min != "" AND duration_seconds = 0);

-- we can see the duration_hours_min column has a lot of nonsense entries (some of the entries are not useable (random sentences (like "my house" or "flash"), or large range of time)).
-- we want to replace these random sentences with NULL

UPDATE sightings_staging
SET duration_hours_min = 
    CASE 
        WHEN (duration_hours_min LIKE '%hour%' OR duration_hours_min LIKE '%min%' OR duration_hours_min LIKE '%sec%' OR duration_hours_min LIKE '%hr%') THEN duration_hours_min
        ELSE NULL
    END
;
-- I will leave duration_hours_min as text type because we have duration_seconds which seems to be a generally more accurate way to get information about the duration of the event
-- duration_hours_min will be there to provide extra information in case it is needed during data exploration

-- b. Rename countries that don't make sense (and make the countries full names instead of abbreviations) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- We want to see distinct countries
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM sightings_staging;

-- There are 5 countries (not including null). I'm going to investigate gb and de

-- country = "gb" 

SELECT * FROM sightings_staging WHERE country = "gb";

-- I noticed that a lot of the citys have (uk/something) I am going to check if they are all like this

SELECT * FROM sightings_staging WHERE country = "gb" AND city NOT LIKE "%(uk%";

-- I can see there are no instances like this. Now I will try to extract the unique instances like "(uk/something)" to see what countries are listed

SELECT distinct country, SUBSTRING(city, LOCATE('(uk', city)) AS city_substring FROM  sightings_staging
WHERE city LIKE '%(uk%' 
ORDER BY city_substring;

-- We have four main countries listed, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland. So depending on what I am planning to do with the data I can either
-- Name each country individually or I can lump them together all under "UK". For the purposes of my data exploration I will just lump these countries together and assign them all as UK 
-- I also noticed instances of ukraine under city names and I do not want to accidentally assign these to the UK
UPDATE sightings_staging
SET
	country = "united kingdom"
WHERE 
	city LIKE '%(uk%' AND city NOT LIKE "%ukraine%" ;
    
-- now I will investigate when country = "de"

SELECT * FROM sightings_staging WHERE country = "de";
-- NOTE: in the city column we have (germany) in brackets next to city name in most columns. 
-- I am going to check if this is the case for all columns (where country = "de")

SELECT * FROM sightings_staging WHERE country = "de" AND city NOT LIKE "%germany%";

-- So there are no instances like this.
-- for the sake of investigation later, I want to change all the country names so that they are the full names of the countries 
-- I will change "de" to "germany" 

UPDATE sightings_staging

-- There seem to be a lot of latiude and longitude coordinated outside of these areas but the country names we have are focused in those areas.
-- Instead of trying to pick apart all the different country names for each of these, I will leave them as blanks and in python (in patrt 2 of this project) I can get the city state and country names from the latitude and longitude coordinates

-- finally I will remove the "(...)" from the entries in the cities column
UPDATE sightings_staging
SET
    city = REGEXP_REPLACE(city, " *\\(.*?\\)", "")

-- c. Change date columns from text to date  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- First I will work on datetime column. Thankfully it looks like this coulumn is uniform and there are no weirdly formatted rows. 
-- This makes it easy to use str_to_date(datetime, "%m/%d/%Y %T") to make this a date column
-- Note the time is in 24 hour time so we have the edge case 24:00 which won't work for str_to_date. So we just need to change these instances to 00:00

UPDATE sightings_staging
SET
    datetime = REPLACE(datetime, "24:00", "00:00")
WHERE 
    datetime LIKE "%24:00%";

-- Now I will convert string to datetime format
    
UPDATE sightings_staging
SET
    datetime = str_to_date(datetime, "%m/%d/%Y %T");

-- Now I can convert the datetime column to date time type

ALTER TABLE `ufo_sightings`.`sightings_staging` 
CHANGE COLUMN `datetime` `datetime` DATETIME NULL DEFAULT NULL ;

-- Now I will work on date_posted column. Thankfully this column also looks to be uniform and there are no weirdly formatted rows. 
-- But notice with this column it is only dates and no time

UPDATE sightings_staging
SET
    date_posted = str_to_date(date_posted, "%m/%d/%Y");

ALTER TABLE `ufo_sightings`.`sightings_staging` 
CHANGE COLUMN `date_posted` `date_posted` DATE NULL DEFAULT NULL ;

-- d. Clean non-alphabetic characters from text columns --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- I noticed in the city and comments columns there are some rows with non alphabetic characters (for example, maplewood&#44).
-- I am going to clean these rows so they are only alphabetic 

UPDATE sightings_staging
SET city = REGEXP_REPLACE(city, '[^a-zA-Z ]', '');

-- I am also going to remove numbers and characters from comments column
-- I am doing this because although there is extra information in the comments column where characters and numbers are being used for a valid reason I am
-- just doing sentiment analysis and getting tokens later on, so the sentences don't need to be exactly the way they would need to be if communicating 
-- the information to another person

UPDATE sightings_staging
SET
    comments = REGEXP_REPLACE(comments, '[^a-zA-Z ]', ''); 

-- e. Convert all blanks to nulls ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Instead of checking each column for blank entries individually, I am going to just check for all columns except datetime, and duration_hours_min because of previous steps 
-- Before I do that, I am going to check if there are rows in the text columns that say unknown

SELECT city, state, country, shape FROM sightings_staging WHERE city LIKE "%unknown%" OR state LIKE "%unknown%" OR country LIKE "%unknown%" OR shape LIKE "%unknown%" ;

-- There are "unknown"s in the city column and the shape column.
-- I am going to check how many in blank entries are in each column before I update the table

-- Now I will change all blank entries to NULL (note for shape and city columns we have the entries "unknown" which I will also change to NULL)
-- We will also use trim() on some of the text columns for cleanliness and uniformity

UPDATE sightings_staging
SET

-- 4. Populate null values
-- There are a few columns where it is possible to get missing information if some of the other columns are filled 
-- For example, if we have state, and city, then we might be able to get country
-- There are two cases I will focus on:
-- 		a. Have (latitude, longitude) and one of (city, state) I can get country
-- 		b. Have (city, state) I can get (country, latitude, longitude)
-- Note I am not using latitude and longitude to get information on city or state because this will not always be accurate

-- a. Have (latitude, longitude, city, state) and Get country --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- To get an estimate on the range of closeness for latitude and longitude, I googled distance between 1 degree on latitude = 69 miles and I checked the width of the countries I have
-- United States, England, Wales, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Scotland, Germany, United Kingdom and the smallest width is 140 miles (Wales)
-- So I will set the range to 1.25 because the chances of a different country with the same city or state name being that close is slim

-- There are no instances like this so now when I update, I will update both in (when possible)

-- This is an improvement. Also, considering that the database is so large (88,000 rows approximately) this is a pretty negligible amount of NA values.
-- There are also cases where it is ok to have NULL values. For example:
--   state: because because there are countries like Germany, Australia, and the UK that don't have "states"
-- 	 country, city: because some of these sightings may have been in the middle of the ocean ie. no country or city (or state)
-- Some of their rows where certain columns are blank might have useful information in different columns. What is important depends on the data exploration questions

-- 5. Drop rows and columns

-- 		duration_hours_min, duration_seconds: I am not looking into how long the sightings lasted
-- Although some of the columns I am deleting are ones I have cleaned, this is ok because we have the scrubbed version of them in case my goals and questions change and I ever do need them

DROP COLUMN `duration_seconds`;

-- Now I want to check which rows I can delete
-- The main location columns that are important for my investigation are latitude and longitude (as city, state and country can be derived from these)
-- I also want to perform a text analysis so I want there to be no nulls in the shape comments columns
-- I also do not want any nulls in the date posted columns

    AND shape IS NOT NULL
	AND date_posted IS NOT NULL
    AND comments IS NOT NULL;

-- There are 78,223 rows 
-- I want to compare this to how many rows are in the database

SELECT count(*) FROM sightings_staging; 

-- There are 88,673 rows in the entire database
-- There is not a huge difference between the two tables. And a table of 78,223 rows is still extremely large
-- So I will just delete rows with NULL values in the "important" columns

DELETE FROM sightings_staging
WHERE latitude IS NULL 
	OR longitude IS NULL 
    OR date_posted IS NULL 
    OR shape IS NULL
    OR comments IS NULL;
    
-- I want to see how large my new table is

SELECT count(*) FROM sightings_staging; 

-- There are 74,731 rows

-- I will just double-check how many NULLs are in each column
