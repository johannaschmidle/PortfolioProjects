Shu,True Value,5.0,Canada ,2024-02-19,"The mini sofa is great, big enough to fit my large cat. Adorable and soft.The only thing is the colour is lighter than what was expected. But overall my cat likes it, and it's his favourite spot to take a nap now.",Yellow
Rebecca Baker,Elderly cat loves it!,5.0,Canada ,2024-02-20,"I bought this in the hopes that one of my older cats, Steven, would lay on it as he kept sneaking into my closet. We also got carpet over our living rooms laminate flooring so we needed something soft. He loves it. Easy to assemble as well. Hopefully it will last a while, so far we've had it for about a month.",Green
CMac,Better than I expected!,5.0,Canada ,2024-02-21,I was so skeptical even after I read the reviews but wanted this so much for my smaller dog. I took a chance and my dog loves it.  Has to be put together (stuff the pillows in each compartment of the bed) and it takes no more than 10 minutes to open and put together. My 40 pound goldendoodle even loves it!,Green
Cj,Better than I thought,4.0,Canada ,2024-02-22,"It's soft, taking apart for washing might be annoying but looks nice, could hold the shape a little better but my pets use it",Yellow

Randi F.,Crappy couch,1.0,Canada ,2024-02-24,"Not enough padding. Doesn't even sit up like a couch would because you have to stuff it with little pads for each section(arms, bottom, back)Not enough stuffing in padsBasically flatCats sits on it and it's flat the ground.Would not recommend would not buy againVery disappointed especially considering the price,  too expensive!!",Blue
RFMN,Stubborn Cat Approved,5.0,Canada ,2024-02-25,"Like all cats she was more interested in the box. But after a quick wash on gentle cycle to get rid of all the extra fuzz it was no longer than 5 minutes before she climbed in, made dough, and went to sleep.Would recommend.",Pink

Chloe,My cat loves this so much she doesn’t want to leave her new couch!!,5.0,Canada ,2024-03-01,My cat adores her new couch sooo much that she has spent the whole day and night sleeping on it 🤣 her new couch with her on it had to be carried upstairs because she didn’t want to get off it to sleep on a human bed. This is the bed of her dreams! I may have to order another later so she has another both up and downstairs. She is obsessed!! Update: I bought her the pink one too so she has pink and blue beds one upstairs one downstairs she loves them both!!,Blue

Kristina H.,Exactly as shown,5.0,Canada ,2024-03-03,"Easy to put together it took her a minute to warm up to it as cats deal with all things but now that she has, she loves it. It washes really easily put together really quickly as well. Sturdy and soft.",Green
Ethan Horner,Not quite like in the picture,3.0,Canada ,2024-03-04,It was nice and soft but a bit smaller than expected. When I read it was for up to 25lb cat I thought my 2 cats could lie on it as they weight about 20 lbs combined but I dont think they can. It looks a bit firmer in the picture. As you can see by my pic the it isnt as firm looking as the ad. However Im sure we will get some use out of it but I think its overpriced. I think its worth half of the cost they charge.,Green
Domenic,"If Colby loves it, any kitty can",5.0,Canada ,2024-03-05,"Colby’s pretty stubborn with what he’ll sleep on. He has 2 fave blankies, a carpet and that’s about it. This mini couch is so soft.

Ruby Atlas,Disappointing,1.0,Canada ,2024-04-06,This is a very flimsy and cheaply made product.

T. Way,Total scam nothing like advertised,1.0,Canada ,2024-04-17,I would give zero stars if possible. It was just a thin pillow insert that came nothing like a couch at all. I got a refund. I totally forgot to take pics b4 I boxed it back up. Very disappointed,Blue

Tyler Tasson,Flat and sad,1.0,Canada ,2024-04-20,I don’t know what I was expecting but this this is so sad and flat and deformed - nothing like the photo. It’s been out to fluff all day with no change. It’s basically a garbage blob of cheap fluff :(,Yellow
Amazon Customer,Very disappointing,1.0,Canada ,2024-04-21,Very disappointed once put together looks nothing like the picture - pillows are too small and little bed looks deformed because of it,White
Alison M Lobsinger,Not the best quality,3.0,Canada ,2024-04-22,"The product isn't the most amazing quality (the pillows that make up the filling are thin and not great quality or the right shape to stuff the sofa pillow case), but the fabric is very plush and my cat loved it instantly.",Black
Susan,Comfy,4.0,Canada ,2024-04-23,My cat loves his new couch. It is soft and comfortable. He naps it in all the time. Very easy to put together. It's great that the cover is washable. I would recommend this Cat sofa 🛋 😻,Black
Randi Allen,Sooo cute,5.0,Canada ,2024-04-24,"Bought it for a place for my kitties to relax instead of on the dining room chairs and softer than the floor. Bigger than I imagined so I was very happy with that. Once you open the packaging, the pillows will fluff up. And as you can see, Mr Earl is loving it",White
Elizabeth McDermott,Cat Bed Pink,5.0,Canada ,2024-04-25,The package it came in was awesome! It was wrapped tightly inside plastic. I opened it and put it together but I was confused at first because I didn't see the zipper in the front. It's so cute. My cat loves it. She's sleeping in it now and I just gave it to her like....30 mins ago. Lol,Pink
Mandy S,My dog LOVES it!,5.0,United States ,2024-04-26,"I have been redecorating a room and my clingy dog has been sad because she didn’t have anywhere designated for her. As soon as I placed this on the floor, she went right to it and got on it! She knew it was hers and let me take her picture in front of it! ❤️ Great buy! She weighs about 10-15 lbs and the length of a weenie dog!",
Ms. Glace,My cat LOVES it!!!,5.0,United States ,2024-04-27,My cat loves this bed! She took right to it and I love that she looks so darn cute on it! She uses the arms as pillows and sleeps on this couch every night. The size is great and it is so soft! The cover slips off and each section is made from a pillow insert. Easy to wash and fluff. 100% recommended. Cat approved.,Green
Tori Netzer,Biscuit factory,5.0,United States ,2024-04-28,My cats love it! They seem to think it’s very cozy and it’s aesthetically pleasing to me. They make biscuits on this little couch nonstop!,

Amazon Customer,Best Cat Sofa Ever!,5.0,United States ,2024-05-01,"When I got the package, I was a little concerned on the amount of stuffing that came with the couch. I got it put together and it was purrfect. My cat and dogs fight over this couch! It’s very soft and cute!",White
Sandra Marino,Cats love it,5.0,United States ,2024-05-02,My fur babies love this couch. Will have order another so that they don't fight over it.,
Katie gross,Not really sturdy,4.0,United States ,2024-05-03,This thing is definitely bigger than I thought but it looks so cute and is wonderful it is a bit flimsy not sure what the filling is but occasionally you do have to fluff it up after a couple of uses,
Emily S.,Cats love the couch,5.0,United States ,2024-05-04,"Do cats like the couch? Yes. Do they use it individually? Yes! Do they use it as a loveseat for cuddles? Yes! When it arrives, it’s small and vacuum sealed. You will have to put the couch filling (in small cushion shapes) inside the couch shell. It’s easy to assemble, disassemble, and clean. When the cushions get worn out, I plan to just replace them with something in that general shape. Good value and the patterns/colors are super cute! I’m happy with the green and brown one.",Green
Janice,Sofa potential in manual shaping.,3.0,United States ,2024-05-05,"I was disappointed that the pet “couch” had No shaping to it. It resembles more of a bean bag with filling that would have to be manipulated quiteA Lot to even begin to have a shape!There is No Form.The picture is Very misleading, as it doesn’t come delivered as a couch ready for my cat to lounge on.Cute checkerboard design ordered…But overall, Disappointed that it doesn’t resemble what is advertised.  :(Janice",
Becka,it’s comfy,4.0,United States ,2024-05-06,padding wasn’t the best so it kinda flipped back. but my cat doesn’t seem to mind.,
N.W,Not worth it at All,1.0,United States ,2024-05-07,"I got this for my senior cats 14 birthday and it sucks. Hardly filled, my cat refused to use it. I thought maybe washing the outside would help because maybe the scent bothered her but when I took the cover off allThe stuffing went everywhere. Wish I could return but I can’t since the stuffing is everywhere. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",
Ariela,Just big enough for my 25 pound dog,5.0,United States ,2024-05-08,It’s extremely cute but probably needs to  be up against the wall as the back doesn’t have much shape to stay up otherwise. My dog is 25 pounds and I’d say if you dog is much bigger than that it probably will be too small but it’s perfect for 25 and under. It’s soft and cute,Black

Susanne DeVenture,Great,5.0,United States ,2024-05-11,My dog loves it,
Amber,Fluffy and good quality,4.0,United States ,2024-05-12,My kitten won't use it😂.But it's great quality and I like that the cover is removable. Sad she doesn't care for it but I do think it's a good product.I would consider maybe switching out the bottom pillow for something a little more study if you have an older cat. Might not be good for their bones and joints.Update: My car sleeps on this every night now that it's not cold so she's not using her heating bed. Hasn't lost its fluff at all 2+ months later. Can't give this product enough props,Yellow
Sarah Kreke,Cute but flimsy,4.0,United States ,2024-05-13,The idea is super cute and so is the design but it definitely needs more stuffing.,
Jammie Meredith,Don’t waste your time or money.,1.0,United States ,2024-05-14,"Only giving a 1 because 0 isn’t an option.Floppy, shape not held.  Looks like found in an old shed after years of having stuff piled on it.  Nothing like the picture.",
Laura,"Terrible quality, not worth the money",1.0,United States ,2024-05-15,I did not receive the item pictured. It lacks the structure of the bed in the design. It isn’t filled enough to hold its shape. It’s a total rip off.,
Alyson P.,Perfect!,5.0,United States ,2024-05-16,My 16 year old Yorkie loves it. It’s big enough that the cat can lay on it with her and they’re not crowding each other. Easy to put together.,
Justin Schell,Couch Queen,5.0,United States ,2024-05-17,"I legit never do reviews but look at my little couch queen. The assembly was easy, just fluffed it a bit. It smelled like packaging so I washed it first and she started using it instantly. Legit adorable. Her couch is next to ours and I just can't. It's soft, the quality is nice. The size is good for one...fluffy cat. Our other 2 cats might need their own because this one won't share but absolutely worth.",White
Carol ohlund,Extremely smaller than the first one!!!!,1.0,United States ,2024-05-18,Be aware of the size! This seller has several different options. The first one I got last week was a good size. This one is like a Mini version .  so not worth the price it should be about 25.00 . they also do not sit up like in the photos. They lack stuffing by Alot. They just fall flat like a blanket.  I do NOT recommend anything from this seller.,
DeeBee,My cat loves this couch!,5.0,United States ,2024-05-19,This couch is super cute. And my cat loves it. She did kind of make a dent in it from laying in it so much lol but it’s easily reshapable. I haven’t gotten to clean the couch yet but I’m sure it would be easy to just take off the cover and wash it and then hang to dry. It does collect some hair but can be removed with a lint roller. Would purchase again.,Blue
S. Reese,Instant success!,5.0,United States ,2024-05-20,My girl is a hefty kitty. I was worried she wouldn’t fit but it’s perfect. She loves snuggling in blankets or on top of me when I’m sitting w/ a blanket which if fine occasionally but when I’m up and down she gets annoyed. Now she has her own little couch 🥰 it’s perfect! Put it together and put some catnip on it and five mins she’s snoozin. So glad I took the chance and bought this.For those complaining of the stuffing being thin- you have to spend a few mins with each cushion before inserting into the cover - and fluff the heck out of it and it’s fine.,White
Susie,Super Little Sofa,5.0,United States ,2024-05-21,My 14-year-old cat seems to have pain worse than just arthritis pain so I got her this cushy couch to sleep on.It has a very padded sofa seat and very well engineered bolsters on either end my two kitties will race to see who gets the sofa.  It shouldn't take long before I have to buy another one so each can  have their own.,Green
Nathan Lee,As advertised,5.0,United States ,2024-05-22,"Looks comfortable, feels great. it's bigger then I had expected so I havn't found the best place for it, but where ever i set it at my fur fam likes to sleep on it. Just note the length when purchasing. That was my personal fault, but honestly I would have still bought it anyway. I made an extra extension to my window area by adding a piece of wood to sit the couch on and they love sitting on it with the window up in the sun. Just an idea for people to consider",
Sydnee,My cat loves her mini couch!,5.0,United States ,2024-05-23,My fur baby is obsessed with our couch and gets sad when she can’t have the human couch all to herself. I bought this for her and was unsure if she’d love it fully. She hasn’t left it since!She’s so happy.10/10,Yellow
