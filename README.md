# UFO Sightings Analysis
This project is inspired by the project that sparked my interest in data analysis. The original project was done in R and it remains my favourite school project to this day. My professor even used it (and still uses it) as an example of a good project when teaching this class.

In this rendition of the project, I explored a UFO Sightings database and re-cleaned and re-analyzed it with my new skills. This project has two parts:
1. Data Cleaning in SQL 
2. Data Exploration and Modeling Done in Python

## Things you can find in my project:
- Analysis thinking and problem-solving
- Researched conclusions (and fun speculative conclusions)
- Text analysis
- Location analysis
- Time analysis
- K-means clustering
- Density calculation using Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
- Sentiment and emotion analysis (tokenization, removal of stopwords, speech tagging, stemming, lemmatization)
